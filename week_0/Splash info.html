		<p>Welcome!</p>
		<p>Splash at Yale is an educational outreach organization designed to share Yalies' enthusiasm with local middle-school and high-school students. We run programs full of classes taught by Yale students. The kids select the classes that most interest them from our course catalog, and then show up excited to hear about everything from pirates to comic book drawing to particle physics.</p>
		<p>For more information, check out the Splash at Yale <a href="https://yale.learningu.org" style="color: orange" target="_blank" ;>website</a>. If it looks like it needs updating, well, that's why I'm taking Front-End Dev.</p>
