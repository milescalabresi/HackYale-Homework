CSS3! 9/24
Style specifies how HTML elements look

Every CSS rule (block of code) has two parts:
	- a selector (indicates elements)
	- a style


Selectors:
	- tag name (easy but rarely used; gives a feel to the whole site; overrides defaults and does global styles)
		- hard to isolate elements
	- class name (easy to select elements; each element can have multiple classes and vice-versa)
		- prefixe class names with a period
	- ID attribute (elements are supposed to be unique to IDs and vice-versa; not very reusable)
		- prefix a pound sign


Style (definition block):
	<property: value;>

	color, background-color
		- take names (get creative), RGB, or hex values
		- no "text-color"
	text-decoration
		- "none" or "underline"
	width, height, font-size
		- percentage or pixel value (not point!)
	border
		- size, style, and color (in that order)


	In the box model, there is HxW containing the content, followed by padding, border, and margin.

Properties:
	display -- inline, block, none (how a style should appear on the page)
	position -- how an element should position itself with respect to the browswer window, the parent element, or relative to sibling elements
		- static (default) -- releative to its sibling
		- fixed -- fixed position in browswer window regardless of where you scroll on the page
		- absolute -- rendered at a specific location in the parent element (actually the first parent element whose position is not static); choose the edge that will require smaller distance
		- relative -- relative to where it *would* be if you didn't specify

HW for next time:
	1) finish command line tutorial
	2) create a "hw1" git repository on GitHub
	3) upload assignment there
	4) on Lore, submit *just* the link to the repository
