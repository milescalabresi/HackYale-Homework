General notes:
make markup in HTML semantic (style sheets should contain most of the markup)
no scrolling on pages is better

home page is ALWAYS "index.html"
use lowercase for everything (tags, attributes, etc.) CONVENTION!

use the folder hwX for assignment number X

use one stylesheet for small sites

Don't use <font>! That's what CSS is for!

Use &lt, &gt to get the '<' '>' chars.
